## Introduction
This is a simple web application for diabetes prediction. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on their health parameters. The app is built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), a Python library for creating web applications with minimal code.

## Project Overview
- The web app allows users to input their health parameters, including total pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI value, diabetes pedigree value, and age.
- When the "Classify" button is clicked, the app uses a pre-trained machine learning model to make a prediction based on the provided input.
- The prediction result, indicating whether the person is diabetic or not, is displayed on the web page.

## Usage
- Users can access the web app locally and input their health parameters to get a diabetes prediction.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Necessary Python libraries as mentioned in the requirements.txt file.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction-app.git
To run the web app, execute the following command:

streamlit run app.py
This will start the Streamlit app, and you can access it in your web browser.
